# Auto-Member-Group-Assignment-SB
Actions to be able to automatically and manually assign members to groups through YouTube membership events.




## **Description** 
 
With this you will be able to have members assigned automatically to groups to be able to have command permissions in Streamer.bot for specific member levels/tiers. 


Members get assigned to a group through these events:
- New Member(Sponsor) Event
- Member Mileston Event
- Gift Membership Received
- Manual Command (for when a user becomes a member offline)

Once a member gets assigned to a group, the date is saved/updated in Streamer.bot for that user as the date they last verified they were a member. Each first words event, Streamer.bot checks to see if it has been 30 days since the membership date and if has been more than 30 days, the member is removed from the group and can no longer use the commands that require that specific member group permission.

In order for them to get assigned back to the group again, they either need to 
1. Renew their membership
2. Send a Member Milestone celebration
3. You have the option to manually assign the member level/tier and date for the member through a command.


## **Import Code**

There should be 3 actions and 1 command.


## **Configuration** 


### C# Compiler

### Your YouTube Member Level/Tier Names
In the `New Member/Milestone/Gift Received Assign To Group` action update the member level/tier names with the names you set up on your channel. 

DO NOT DELETE THEM. Even if you don't have that many levels/tiers, you need to leave them in for the code to work.

For example, if your level 1 member tier was `Level 1` you would update the text `[Level/Tier 1 Member Name Here]` to `Level 1`

Do this for however many levels/tiers you have.




### Group Configuration

You will need to add the group names in > Settings > Groups

![image](https://github.com/Haunter56/Auto-Member-Group-Assignment-SB/assets/107263697/1a25c043-d8fd-4c99-8053-e1a41ed9eac3)

Add "Members Level #" for each level/tier you have. (Members Level 1, Members Level 2, etc.)

OPTIONAL - You can change the group names to your member level/tier names, just make sure to update the sub-actions of all 3 actions with the updated Streamer.bot group names

![image](https://github.com/Haunter56/Auto-Member-Group-Assignment-SB/assets/107263697/70d92949-12c3-438b-a31c-47e602e89f9e)



They must match the group names you create exactly. If you don't have up to 5 member levels/tiers, then just update the ones you have and leave the other ones as they are.


## **Using the Command** 

There is a command `!addmember` that you can use to manually add users to your member groups

```diff
- **Before activating the command, be sure to note or copy down the user ID**
```

After you activate the command through chat or any other trigger, you will be prompted to enter 3 pieces of data:

### 1 - The user ID

This can be found in the `Viewers` tab by clicking on a user and copying their ID:

Then enter it into the window:

### 2 - The date the user became a member.

You can estimate this, or use the actual date if you want. Just remember that the next time the user triggers first words, if it has been 30 days from the date you enter, they will be removed from all member groups. They will need to trigger a new member (sponsor) event or member milestone event if they want to be added back automatically.
**Make sure to put the date format in `yyyy-MM-dd`

### 3 - The member level/tier you are assigning.

This should be a number with the minimum accepted value of `0` and the maximum accepted value of `5`

After adding all the inputs, if there was anything wrong with the date or level you entered, a message will be sent telling you which imput did not work.

To check that the user is now in the member group in Streamer.bot you can go back to the `Viewers` tab and see if they are now in the group:
